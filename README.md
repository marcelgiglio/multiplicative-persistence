After seeing this video below, i tryed to make it and give it some improvements.

In the video he mentioned some things we could make so we can skip a lot of numbers, but i couldn't implement it yet.

Here is the lowest numbers for each times can multiply it's digits:
0-> 0
1-> 10
2-> 25
3-> 39
4-> 77
5-> 679
6-> 6788
7-> 68889
8-> 2677889
9-> 26888999
10-> 3778888999
11-> 277777788888899

Can you make it best so we can find the 12th?
